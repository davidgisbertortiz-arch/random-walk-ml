# Random Walk + Machine Learning: Enhanced Edition

**Goal:** Simulate 1D/multi-dimensional random walks and train ML models to predict the *next step* (+1 / −1) from a sliding window of past steps, with extensive real-world applications.

## 🎯 Why This Matters (Physics × ML × Business)

A fair random walk has no memory—each step is independent. However, when we mix **fair** and **biased** walks, ML models can learn to detect latent bias patterns from short histories. This principle applies to:

- **Financial Markets**: Detecting momentum/mean-reversion in asset prices
- **Industrial IoT**: Sensor drift detection and predictive maintenance  
- **Healthcare**: Continuous monitoring and early warning systems
- **Cybersecurity**: Anomaly detection in network traffic patterns

## 🚀 What's New in Enhanced Edition

- ✅ **Sensor Drift Detection**: Industrial IoT monitoring with realistic noise
- ✅ **Production Guidelines**: Complete deployment checklist and ROI analysis
- ✅ **Performance Benchmarking**: Expected ROC-AUC ranges by domain

market_bias = BiasDistribution(
    fair_prob=0.2,           # 20% neutral markets
    positive_bias_prob=0.4,  # 40% bull markets  
    negative_bias_prob=0.4,  # 40% bear markets
    positive_bias_range=(0.55, 0.65),
    negative_bias_range=(0.35, 0.45)
)

cfg = WalkConfig(bias_distribution=market_bias)
```

### 2. Advanced Feature Engineering

```python
# Extract comprehensive features
features = FeatureConfig(
    use_raw_deltas=True,     # Basic sequence patterns
    use_statistics=True,     # Mean, std, skewness
    use_trend=True,          # Linear trend detection
    statistics=["mean", "std", "skew", "range"]
)

X, y, groups = make_windows_from_walks_enhanced(
    positions, feature_config=features
)
```

### 3. Multi-Dimensional Support

# Generate 2D random walks
cfg_2d = WalkConfig(dimensions=2, n_walks=200)
positions_2d, biases_2d = generate_random_walks_nd(cfg_2d)

# Applications: robot navigation, portfolio optimization
```

### 4. Production-Ready Baselines

```python
# Always compare against baselines
models = ["dummy_majority", "dummy_stratified", "logreg", "rf", "hgb"]

for model_name in models:
    pipeline = build_pipeline(model_name)
    # Proper group-aware validation
    results = tune_with_cv(pipeline, X_train, y_train, groups_train)
```

## 🚨 Critical Success Factors

### Must-Have Practices
✅ **Group-aware validation** (prevents data leakage)  
✅ **Baseline comparisons** (validates signal vs noise)  
✅ **Performance mode selection** (FAST for exploration, FULL for production)
✅ **Business metric alignment** (not just ML metrics)  
✅ **Performance monitoring** (detect model degradation)  
✅ **Gradual deployment** (A/B testing, risk management)  

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
❌ Standard K-fold validation (causes overfitting)  
❌ Ignoring dummy classifier performance  
❌ Running FULL mode without need (wastes time in exploration)
❌ Over-engineering features on small datasets  
❌ Optimizing accuracy instead of business value  
❌ Deploying without proper monitoring  

### Performance Troubleshooting

**If notebook runs too slowly:**
1. Switch to `MODE = "FAST"` (30-second runtime)
2. Reduce dataset size: `n_walks=100, n_steps=200`
3. Increase window size: `window=50` (fewer samples)
4. Use single model: `models=["hgb"]`

**If accuracy is too low:**
1. Check bias distribution (need mixed biased/fair walks)
2. Verify group-aware splitting is working
3. Compare against dummy baselines
4. Try enhanced features: `use_statistics=True`  

## 🔬 Advanced Extensions

### Deep Learning Integration
- **LSTM/GRU**: For very long sequences (window >100)
- **Expected gain**: 5-15% over traditional ML
- **Requirements**: 50K+ samples, GPU resources

- **Benefits**: Adapts to changing conditions
- **Tools**: River, scikit-multiflow

### Ensemble Methods
- **Multi-window ensembles**: Combine predictions from different window sizes
